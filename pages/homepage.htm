    <p>
        This file has been included only so that you don't immediately see a broken link message when pulling up a brand new site if you've not already populated pages into the theme.
        On that note, now would be a good time to log in to the backend, and get to work building something awesome! Go ahead, you can do it!

        The official <a href="https://octobercms.com/docs/cms/themes" target="_blank">October Documentation</a> is always a good place to start.

        <small>If this link doesn't work, you probably have defined a different path for the backend than the default, so you must know what you're doing, you can find your own way...</small>
